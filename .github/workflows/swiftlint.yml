      # Okay this (strict mode) does work and I do prefer it, as it will fail the run if the code is not validating
      #  ~all~ rules, even warnings. I prefer this behaviour, as its more obvious something is wrong. In order to
      #  see what is wrong, under the PR go to the 'Files changed' tab, then scroll right to the bottom in which there
      #  is a sub-heading 'Unchanged files with check annotations (Beta)' in which I really wish these annotations were
      #  placed onto the main PR page.
